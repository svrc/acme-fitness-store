# ACME Fitness Store

ACME Fitness store is a fictional online retailer selling sporting goods. This repo contains the source code and deployment scripts for the ACME Fitness store application.

## High Level Architecture

This application is composed of several services:

* 4 Java Spring Boot applications:
  * A catalog service for fetching available products. 
  * A payment service for processing and approving payments for users' orders
  * An identity service for referencing the authenticated user
  * An assist service for infusing AI into fitness store

* 1 Python application:
  * A cart service for managing a users' items that have been selected for purchase

* 1 ASP.NET Core applications:
  * An order service for placing orders to buy products that are in the users' carts

* 1 NodeJS and static HTML Application
  * A frontend shopping application

The sample can be deployed to Azure Spring Apps Enterprise or Tanzu Application Platform.

Note: ensure that the environment variable for TAS has 
`SPRING_MVC_STATIC_PATH_PATTERN: /static/images/**` set.  Currently have an issue with the value taken from config server being overwritten.

## Local Development setup



### Config server
Config in TAS is created by a Repo backed tile. For local development, included [docker-compose.yml](./local-development/docker-compose.yaml) will start up an instance of config-server on port 8888. 

```bash
cd local-development
docker compose up -d config
```

### Discovery server
Spring boot apps (Identify, Catalog, Payment, Assist) communicate via TAS service registry. For local development, included [docker-compose.yml](./local-development/docker-compose.yaml) starts up a local instance of Eureka discovery server on port 8761.

```bash
cd local-development
docker compose up -d discovery
```

### Tanzu Local Authentication Server
Follow the instructions on ["Getting Started with Tanzu Local Authorization Server"](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Tanzu-Spring-Runtime/Commercial/Tanzu-Spring-Runtime/local-auth-server-about-local-auth-server.html) page to obtain the jar executable from Broadcom download portal.

Place the jar named as `tanzu-local-authorization-server-beta4.jar` into the directory `local-development/spring-cloud-gateway`.

Given jar is placed correctly, included [docker-compose.yml](./local-development/docker-compose.yaml) starts up a local instance of Tanzu Local Authentication Server on port 9000.

```bash
cd local-development
docker compose up -d auth
```

### Spring Cloud Gateway Server

Obtain from Broadcom download portal to get the Spring Commercial Gateway Jar for running local.
Place the jar named as `gateway-2.2.4.jar` into the directory `local-development/spring-cloud-gateway`

Given jar is placed correctly, included [docker-compose.yml](./local-development/docker-compose.yaml) starts up a local instance of Spring Cloud Gateway Server on port 8090.

```bash
cd local-development
docker compose up -d gateway
```

> **Additional information:**  
> In the [docker-compose.yaml](local-development/docker-compose.yaml) under local-development folder, ensure the Authorization server is referenced.
> ```yaml
>   gateway:
>     ...
>     environment:
>       SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_SSO_ISSUER_URI: http://auth:9000
> ```
